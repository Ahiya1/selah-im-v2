# API Integration Points for Other Builders

## Sacred Intake Submission
Branch 1 submits applications to Branch 2's Claude analysis:

```typescript
// POST /api/applications/submit
interface SacredIntakeData {
  preferred_name: string
  email: string  
  discovery_story: string
  tech_relationship: string
}

// Expected response from Branch 2
interface SubmissionResponse {
  success: boolean
  application_id: string
  message: string
}
```

## Form Data Structure
The sacred intake flow collects four pieces of contemplative data:

1. **Personal Recognition** (preferred_name): How the user wishes to be addressed
2. **Email Connection** (email): Contact method for personalized communication
3. **Discovery Story** (discovery_story): How they found contemplative technology
4. **Technology Relationship** (tech_relationship): Their consciousness-technology insights

## Integration Points for Other Branches

### For Branch 2 (Claude AI Intelligence)
- Receives complete SacredIntakeData via `/api/applications/submit`
- Should analyze contemplative readiness and personalization vectors
- Returns success/failure response to maintain contemplative flow

### For Branch 3 (Email Communication)
- Triggered by successful Branch 2 analysis
- Uses personalization data for email generation
- Maintains sacred timing in communication

### For Branch 4 (Admin Dashboard)
- Displays applications with contemplative analytics
- Shows Claude analysis results
- Manages beta status with consciousness-serving approach
